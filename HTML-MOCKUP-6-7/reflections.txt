For this project, I learned three new html tags to create strikethrough text, superscript text, and page breaks. I also had to learn some special characters to make "curly" quotes appear correctly. The easiest part of this project was dividing the text into individual elements to format the page. The most challenging part was figuring out how to create special characters. I used google to see if anyone else had already solved this problem, and they had. It was simple to find a table of special characters and put them in my html file once I knew what I was looking for.
